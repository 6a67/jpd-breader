# JPDB Web Reader Extension

A browser extension that parses any text in your browser using JPDB, and allows you to mine new vocabulary from any page!

## Is this ready to use yet?

No

## Current Limitations

* Only supports Firefox
* Only works on [ッツ Reader](https://reader.ttsu.app)
* Any network connectivity issues crash the extension and require a reload
* Updating to a new version requires manually clearing the paragraph parse cache in the extension background page's indexedDB

## Ongoing Work

* Handle errors in a more resilient fashion
* Package for installation
* Settle on a cache database format
* And a menu to adjust settings and clear caches
* Port to Chrome

## Installation

Good luck

## Usage

Difficult

## Contributing

Issues with feedback or ideas are welcome. You can also message me on the JPDB Discord server.

Because this project is still very early in development, the code will likely move too fast to meaningfully contribute to.
If that does not disuade you, feel free to submit pull requests anyway.
